Some toothfish populations are more healthy and abundant than others.     The existence of toothfish fisheries is controversial for a variety of reasons. These include the lack of knowledge of some aspects of the species' life history, ecology, and population dynamics, as well as its vulnerability to overexploitation, particularly from its prior history with illegal fishing. But thanks to scrutiny of fishing activities, new data, and numerous enforcement measures in recent years, this activity has dramatically decreased. The U.S. prohibits the import of illegally caught toothfish, and importers must hold a permit, as well as a pre-approval certificate for each U.S. bound shipment of toothfish. Some illegal fishing activity still occurs in the high seas (unregulated), and these products may be sold in markets outside the U.S. It's still unclear how these illegal takes of toothfish may affect the well-managed fisheries.     Antarctic toothfish, the cold water relative, are found in the Ross Sea and considered abundant based on careful review of data from landings and recent independent research into population health. Despite some unknowns of its population structure and their unique habitat, any new information on its life history is incorporated when setting catch limits. Many vessels from a number of nations comprise this fishery and thereby vary in enforcement approaches, but measures include observers and monitoring systems stationed on every vessel, satellite surveillance, vessel inspections, and routine reviews of compliance. The significant ice season in the Ross Sea curtails the level of fishing activity possible there.  <br></br>  Most toothfish are caught by bottom longline, which is known to have some impact on seafloor habitats. To reduce this the Ross Sea fishery has designated many areas closed to fishing. Work is ongoing to identify and protect vulnerable marine ecosystems.  <br></br>  Bycatch varies widely in toothfish fisheries that use bottom longline. In the Ross Sea, threatened or vulnerable species such as skates, rays, and large numbers of grenadiers are caught, with some catch limits imposed. In addition, independent scientific observers report all catch data.  <br></br>",NULL,http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/content/media/MBA_SeafoodWatch_ChileanSeabassReport.pdf,Chilean Seabass Seafood Watch Report,http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/content/media/MBA_SeafoodWatch_Longlining&PurseSeiningFactCards.pdf,Longlining Fact Card,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Gulf corvina is fished year-round in the Gulf of California and is usually only available in the local region immediately surrounding the Gulf.     ","Gulf corvina is found only in the cooler northern waters of the Gulf of California and the Colorado River delta. Unable to survive in the warmer waters to the south, Gulf corvina is limited to a relatively small habitat. Any species with a small habitat range is extremely vulnerable to changes in conditions and the corvina is no exception. Habitat degradation in the Gulf as well as the river delta has reduced corvina populations. Important spawning and nursery habitat in the Colorado River delta has been degraded by upstream water diversions, which lower the flow of freshwater and change temperature and sediment conditions.   <br><br>    Its small and very limited range also makes Gulf corvina vulnerable to overfishing. Indeed, the population has been - and continues to be - severely overfished. Contributing to the problem is the minimal and ineffective management of the fishery. As a result, fewer and smaller fish are being caught than just a few years ago. Two types of fishing gear used for Gulf corvina, gillnets and trawls, lead to serious bycatch and habitat damage.   <br><br>    For these reasons, Gulf corvina is ranked as an ""Avoid.""",NULL,http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/content/media/MBA_SeafoodWatch_GulfofCalifornia_Guide.pdf,Gulf of California Seafood Watch Report,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

The handline fishery is considered the ""Best Choice"" for California yellowtail due to its low bycatch and the lack of other significant conservation concerns in the fishery.  <br></br>",NULL,http://www.seafoodwatch.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/content/media/MBA_SeafoodWatch_CAYellowtail_WhiteSeabassReport.pdf,California Yellowtail Seafood Watch Report,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL

Yellowtail has numerous market names and there are many fish with this name, so it is important to ask where the yellowtail is from prior to purchase.","This report assesses the yellowtail fishery managed by Buzos y Pescadores de Baja California, a fishing cooperative in Isla Natividad, Mexico. This cooperative has prohibited the use of gillnets by members, therefore all yellowtail in this fishery is caught using handline.  <br></br>  Handline gear in the yellowtail fishery does not contact the seafloor and has benign habitat impacts. Bycatch in the handline fishery is negligible and any bycatch is released alive and in good condition. The status of the California yellowtail population is poorly known.
